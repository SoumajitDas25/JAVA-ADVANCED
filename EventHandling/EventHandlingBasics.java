package EventHandling;

//An Event is a change in the state of an object or source.
//Event handling is the mechanism that controls the event & decides what should happen if an event occurs.
//Event handling is done by Event Delegation Model

//Event Delegation Model:
//A Model in which the User Interface element delegates the processing of an event to a separate piece of code(Event handler code).
//It comprises two entities: Source & Listener
//Source is an Object on which any event occurs & it provides the occurred event info to the handler/listener. Ex- Button
//Listener/Handler provides response to the event. Ex- code that handles that what should happen if a button is clicked
//Every source has to be registered with the listener.
//The benefit of using Event Delegation Model is that the User Interface code is completely separated from the event handler code.

//Different types of Listener:
//1. ActionListener
//2. ItemListener
//3. KeyListener
//4. MouseListener
//5. MouseMotionListener
